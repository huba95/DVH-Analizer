# DVH-Analizer
My thesis project at BSc

In our work we developed a program to make the analyses easier. With the help of the program the Dxx and Vxx values of the DVH can be easily found of the chosen ROI. There is already five given methods of analyzes. 
Finding Relative Volume to Absolute Dose, or Absolute Dose to Relative Volume, or Relative Volume to relative Dose, or Absolute Volume to Relative Dose, or Absolute Volume to Absolute Dose. These types were the most important in our work, but we have future plans to develop the remainig three types. 
The software has another important function, when we have similar plans we can analyze them on the same way. With the program we donâ€™t have to do it one-by-one, because the program gives the opportunity to analyze them automatically with the help of a so-called input file. And there is already two options to evaluate plans. The program can calculate HI and CN. 
The program was developed in C++ and the user interface in Qt.



## This was my first big project a few years ago when I didn`t know clean code or Git
## I am working on a new version of this program in C# with my fresh knowledge
